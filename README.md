# Taxon

This is a demo project to go along with a presentation that can be found at https://travispoulsen.com/blog/presentations/graphql.html.

After starting the server, visit [graphiql](http://localhost:4000/graphiql) to play around with the GraphQL api.

To start:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
